**üîç Project Overview:**

Developed a logistic regression model using the UCI Heart Disease dataset to predict high-risk individuals for heart disease. The project incorporated a training/test data split and A/B testing to enhance model accuracy and validate results, helping Kaiser Permanente optimize insurance premiums and offer targeted wellness programs.

**üß† Key Responsibilities & Skills Demonstrated:**

**Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**

Cleaned and preprocessed the UCI Heart Disease dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data types.
Ensured proper feature selection by analyzing the significance of variables like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

**A/B Testing & Model Validation:**

Performed A/B testing to compare the performance of different model configurations and features, ensuring the most effective combination for heart disease prediction.
Validated model results on the testing set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

**Business Insights & Recommendations:**
Identified high-risk individuals for heart disease and provided actionable recommendations for targeted wellness programs.
Provided insights for adjusting insurance premiums based on risk levels and reducing future claims by promoting preventive care.

**‚úÖ Key Outcomes:**
Developed a predictive logistic regression model to identify high-risk individuals for heart disease with high accuracy and precision.
Provided Kaiser Permanente with a data-driven approach to adjust premiums, reduce claims, and implement targeted wellness programs.
Delivered actionable insights into customer health risks, supporting strategic decisions in preventive care and risk management.

**üíª Tools Used:**

*Python: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for logistic regression modeling, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
*Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis, model development, and visualization.
NumPy & SciPy: Used for numerical operations and statistical analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Created visualizations for exploratory data analysis and model evaluation metrics.
